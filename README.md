# BKDoc

Better, simpler markup language for prose, notes, documentation, and more.

BKDoc is both a markup language and a commandline tool for rendering that
markup language to other document formats. That means that you write a
document in BKDoc format, and then can generate webpages, pdfs, and other
document formats.
